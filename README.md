# EarthquakeCityMapApp
Application I worked on during "Object Oriented Programming in Java" course on Coursera. It shows latest earthquakes on the map. You can also check if particular city is in affected zone. ***IMPORTANT: Need Java 8 or OLDER. Branch master works on Eclipse. IntelliJ version is on intellij branch (this IDE needs main function to run PApplets).***
