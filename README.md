# EarthquakeCityMapApp
Application I worked on during "Object Oriented Programming in Java" course on Coursera. It shows lates earthquakes on the map. You can also check if particular city is in affected zone. ***IMPORTANT: Need Java 8 or OLDER. Works on Eclipse.*** I am trying to make it run on IntelliJ.
